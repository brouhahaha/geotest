"My travels" by Vladimir Gilyarovsky on the map
==============================================

Our **aim** was to visualize the itinerary of trips made by main character of an autobiographical book "My travels".

In this book he describes how he traveled across Russia with circus, theater, army and on his own. Weâ€™ve read the book and took out all the places he explicitly says he visited. All the places are supported by a short citation in a separate file.

The maps were created manually using [geojson](http://geojson.io/) tools. 

# Features:
* **Points** mark exact locations mentioned in the text: _cities and towns, villages, estates._ Each point contains information about the chapters where this location appears and in some cases the name of location.
* **Lines** connect points that the character passes on his way. Each line represent one chapter.
